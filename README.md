If we were able to drastically reduce the costs of being diagnosed with such a cancer, we would help a lot, a lot with the early detection of tumors, which would improve people's quality of life considerably.
* **Python libraries used:** API de Queras, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
* **Techniques used:** RestNet, Convolution techniques, transfer learning, dual model, ResUnet.
* **Trainning:** A total of three thousand nine hundred MRIs of the brain, along with the exact location of where in the brain the particular tumor is located.
* **Input:** A X-rays, MRIs or others.
* **Output:** Detect if the tumor exists or does not exist, at the same time, locate exactly segmenting the image with which region the presence of that tumor corresponds to.
