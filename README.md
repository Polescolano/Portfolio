The world of Deep Learning is proving to be superior in detecting diseases from X-rays, MRIs or thugs, which means that diseases can be diagnosed more quickly and more accurately than a doctor would in this case study.<br>

In this case, we are talking about the fact that we seek to accelerate and improve the speed and precision with which we detect and locate malignant tumors through magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

If we were able to drastically reduce the costs of being diagnosed with such a cancer, we would help a lot, a lot with the early detection of tumors, which would improve people's quality of life considerably.
* **Python libraries used:** API de Queras, TensorFlow
* **Techniques used:** RestNet, Convolution techniques, transfer learning, dual model.
* **Input:** A total of three thousand nine hundred MRIs of the brain, along with the exact location of where in the brain the particular tumor is located.
* **Output:** Detect if the tumor exists or does not exist, at the same time, locate exactly segmenting the image with which region the presence of that tumor corresponds to.
